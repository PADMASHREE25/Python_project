In this, I have written the code for calaculator to perform basic operations like addition, subtraction,multiplication and division.By using function for each operation.Whenever the function is called, it will perform accordingly. It will also return the result value which can be used further.
The code is as follows,

def add(a, b):
    res = a+b
    print(res)
    return res


def sub(a, b):
    diff = a-b
    print(diff)
    return diff


def mul(a, b):
    prod = a*b
    print(prod)
    return prod


def div(a, b):
    quot = a/b
    print(quot)
    return quot
